# M1-MacBook-brightness-control
Allows you to control the keyboard backlight with your keyboards again

Annoyed that you now have a dedicated button for **spotlight**, **dictation**, and **focus**? Tired of using the Control Center to control your keyboard brightness?
Using the feature built into macos you can bring back the old features and **control the brightness of your keyboard backlight using the old way**.(Also open up launchpad) 

## Install
1. Copy the "com.local.KeyRemapping.plist" to "~/Library/LaunchAgents"
2. Reboot
